   <h2>About me</h2>
   <p>Hello. I'm Zhining Gu. You can also call me Emily.
​
As a student in IXD program at Pratt, I’d like to focus on products and designs that related to people’s everyday life. My personal interest is on the interaction between user and products.
 
My current goals and direction are influenced by the coops I have experienced. I had three coop experiences at design consultancy companies and one experience at an independent design studio.
 
If you are interested in my experiences and skills, you can check my resume and portfolio at zhininggu.com. </p>
